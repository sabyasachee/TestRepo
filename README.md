# Knowledge Transfer and Boosting Approach to Affect Prediction in Movies

## Description
We address the problem of continuous affect prediction in movies, constrained by the availability of limited in-domain data, by using a knowledge transfer (KT) + gradient boosting (GB) approach. KT learns models on a larger dataset of shorter video clips, that are then adapted to make continuous predictions of valence and arousal for the LIRIS-ACCEDE dataset, using audio-visual features.
